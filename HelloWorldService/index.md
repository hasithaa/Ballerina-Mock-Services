## Overview

This sample contains a simple REST service that accepts HTTP requests at:

1. GET `http://localhost:8080/HelloService/greet`
2. GET `http://localhost:8080/HelloService/greet/{name}`

See the OpenAPI definition of the service generated by the Ballerina OpenAPI tool <button class="tablinks" title="Show File" onclick="openCode(event, 'HelloService_openapi.yaml')">Here.</button>

## Running the sample

1. First, clone or open the code using above given options.
2. Then navigate to the `HelloWorld` directory and execute the following command to start the service:

    ```bash
    $ ballerina run .
    ```

## Testing

{{< admonition tip >}}
As a good practice, you can write unit tests for your code to verify that it meets your expectations. You can use Ballerina's built-in testing framework to write unit tests. 
This example contains unit tests for each resource available in the service. 
The following command executes the unit tests that are available in the `tests` directory:

```bash
bal test
```

Additionally, You can use curl command-line tool to create HTTP requests for your Ballerina service. Here are the examples:

1. To access the greet resource which doesn't require any parameters, you can use the following command:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/HelloService/greet
```

2. To access the greet resource with a parameter (for example, "John"), you can use the following command:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/HelloService/greet/John
```

In both cases, replace localhost with the IP address or hostname of the machine where your Ballerina service is running if it's not on your local machine. Also, replace `8080` with the port number your service is listening on if it's different.
